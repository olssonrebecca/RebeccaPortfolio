  <p>
    My name is Rebecca Olsson. Iâ€™m 30 years old and originally from Sweden.<br />
    I fell in love with coding while studying for my M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering. <br />
    After graduating, I began my career as an IT Consultant in Web Development at 
    <a href="https://www.knowit.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knowit</a>. <br />
    Combining my technical skills with my social strengths is something I find very motivating.
                  <br /><br />
    In the fall of 2022, I moved to Canada. After spending time securing my Permanent Residence, I began working as a 
    Web Developer & Digital Marketing Specialist for Gibbons Whistler, where I independently maintain 7 websites.
                 <br /><br />
    Outside of work, I love outdoor activities such as skiing, downhill biking, hiking, and camping. I also enjoy concerts (especially indie and rock), game nights with friends, and baking!
