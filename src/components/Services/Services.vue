                    I am a Full-stack developer who's building and maintaining Websites with technologies such as HTML, CSS, Vue, JS, C# .Net, SQL and the CMS system Episerver. I deliver strong customer experiences through pre studies, development, testing and deployment.
                    <br /><br />
                    I work hard to solve problems and to achieve a high quality. My driving force is to develop my knowledge and skills, and that is why I like coding. The possibilities are endless and I am very eager to learn more.

                <h2>Leadership</h2>
                <p>
                    With my experience of leadership and being a structured, perceptive and outgoing person, I am sure I will be a great leader or a cooperative team member. I have an eye for what needs to be done and seeing people's strengths, that makes me able to divide tasks that enhances the team.<br /><br />
                    I participated in a leadership program where I learned about leadership, presentation techniques, communication, feedback, gender equality and much more, and I am excited to adapt these tools in a team.
