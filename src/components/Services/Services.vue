                   I am a Full-stack developer who's building and maintaining Websites with technologies such as HTML, Sass, Vue, JavaScript, C# .Net, Microsoft SQL and the CMS system Episerver. My strongest field is Front-End development with focus on user experience and accessability. I deliver strong customer experiences through pre studies, development, testing and deployment.
                    <br /><br />
                    I work hard to solve problems and to achieve a high quality. My driving force is to develop my knowledge and skills, and that is why I like coding. The possibilities are endless and I am very eager to learn more.

                <h2>Teamwork</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a team player that enjoys working closely with a team and with my social skills I communicate well with both clients and the team.<br />
                    As a structured, perceptive and outgoing person, with experience of teamwork and leadership, I am sure I will be a great leader or a cooperative team member. I have an eye for what needs to be done and seeing people's strengths, which makes me able to divide tasks that enhances the team.<br /><br />
                    I participated in a leadership program where I learned about leadership, presentation techniques, communication, feedback, gender equality and much more, and I am excited to adapt these tools in a team.
