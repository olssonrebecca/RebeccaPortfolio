                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a Full-stack developer who's building and maintaining Websites with technologies such as HTML, CSS, Vue, JavaScript, C# .Net, Microsoft SQL and the CMS Optimizely. My strongest field is Front-End development with focus on user experience, responsiveness and accessability. I deliver strong customer experiences through pre studies, development, testing and deployment.
                    <br /><br />
                    I thrive in fast-paced environments, where I get to use my organizational skills and attention to detail to prioritize tasks and manage time effectively. I work hard to solve problems and to achieve a high quality. My driving force is to develop my knowledge and skills, and that is why I like coding. The possibilities are endless and I am very eager to stay up to date.

                <h2>Teamwork</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a cooperative team player who believes that diverse perspectives lead to the best outcomes. With strong social skills, I communicate effectively with both colleagues and clients to understand their needs. I seek to be part of a supportive team that fosters collaboration and encourages growth to achieve shared and ambitious goals.
                    <br /><br />
                    As a structured, perceptive and outgoing person I easily recognize people's strengths,  allowing me to seek help, empower others, and delegate tasks to enhance team performance. These strengths combined with tools I gained from a leadership program, I believe that I can be a great team leader as well.
